🚀 **AI MLOps Project** – A production-grade MLOps pipeline combining Big Data processing, scalable training workflows, and LLM-powered analytics.

This end-to-end solution features:  
- Data ingestion from S3 using Apache Spark  
- Model training with full MLflow tracking (parameters, metrics, models, artifacts)  
- Automated data reporting using OpenAI's Generative AI  
- Testing via `pytest`  
- CI/CD workflows powered by GitHub Actions  
- Dockerized deployment pipeline

✅ Fully compatible with Ubuntu + GitHub Actions  
✅ Cloud extensible (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
✅ Docker-ready with automated image build and deployment  
✅ Modular design for fast customization and reuse

## 🔍 Model and Training Pipeline

Starting from a synthetic CSV file, the project performs batch ingestion with Apache Spark, followed by feature engineering in Pandas. The preprocessed data is used to train a Random Forest classifier on a binary classification task: purchase vs. non-purchase.

The model predicts, for each event with its features (including value and timestamp), whether it's a purchase (1) or another action (0, e.g., click/view/signup). Results are logged with MLflow, and reports are generated via OpenAI.

## 🔧 Requirements

* **Python** 3.8+ (3.10 or 3.11 recommended)  
* **Java** 8+ (for Apache Spark)  
* **Docker**  
* **MLflow** CLI (`pip install mlflow`)  
* **AWS CLI** / GCP SDK / Azure CLI  
* **Git**  
* **OpenAI API key** (for generative AI)

---

## ⚙️ Ubuntu Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/impesud/ai-mlops-project.git
   cd ai-mlops-project
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtualenv**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure AWS profile**  
   Edit `~/.aws/config`:
   ```ini
   [<AWS_user>]
   region = eu-central-1
   ```
   Export environment variable:
   ```bash
   export AWS_PROFILE=<AWS_user>
   ```

4. **Set OpenAI key**  
   Add in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. **Update `config.yaml`**  
   Edit `data_ingestion/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   format: csv
   path: s3a://my-mlops-raw-data/
   output_path: s3a://my-mlops-processed-data/
   local_output_path: data/processed
   aws:
     region: eu-central-1
   test_size: 0.2
   random_seed: 42
   model_params:
     n_estimators: 100
     max_depth: 5
   generative_ai:
     enabled: true
     prompt: "Data analysis"
     output_path: "report.txt"
   ```

## 🧩 Components

* `data_ingestion/`: Spark batch/streaming, data cleaning, write to S3/local  
* `data_processing/`: notebooks + transformations  
* `models/`: training (`train.py`), SMOTE, feature engineering, MLflow tracking  
* `scripts/`: orchestrator `pipeline.py` (ingestion, training, AI, logging)  
* `mlops/`: `entrypoint.sh` for MLflow Tracking Server  
* `generative_ai/`: `generate.py` for LLM reports (OpenAI)  
* `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD and automated testing

---

## 🎯 Usage Example

```bash
# Activate virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate

# Full pipeline
python scripts/pipeline.py

# Separate steps
bash scripts/run_ingest.sh
bash scripts/run_train.sh

# Generate AI report
python generative_ai/generate.py --prompt "Data analysis" --output report.txt
```

---

## 📊 MLflow UI

Launch MLflow UI:
```bash
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ./mlruns --port 5000
```

Access: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)  
View:
1. Parameters and metrics  
2. Model and signature  
3. `report.txt` artifact generated by LLM

---

## ⚙️ MLOps and Tracking Server

Start MLflow Tracking Server:
```bash
bash mlops/entrypoint.sh
```
Access:
```bash
http://localhost:5000
```
Can be used in Docker containers or local networks.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The `test/` folder includes automated tests with `pytest`.

| File             | Validates                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `test_ingest.py` | Generation of Parquet files                |
| `test_train.py`  | Model logging and artifact in MLflow       |

Run all tests:
```bash
pytest test/
```

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions pipeline performs:

1. Python environment and dependency setup
2. Data ingestion + model training
3. Full MLflow logging
4. Automated testing with pytest
5. Trained model artifact upload
6. Docker image build and push to Docker Hub
7. Deployment and inference endpoint test using `mlflow models serve`

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Advanced feature engineering (hour, day, user stats)  
2. Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna  
3. Containerization + Helm + Docker/K8s deploy  
4. Dynamic prompts + artifact logging  
5. CI/CD with SonarQube + environments  
6. Model serving with `mlflow models serve` or FastAPI
