## üß∂ Overview

This document provides complete technical documentation of the data processing pipeline and feature engineering used to build the behavioral purchase prediction model.

The entire pipeline transforms raw user event logs into a fully cleaned, enriched dataset ready for machine learning training.

## üîé Raw Input Data Schema

| Column Name  | Type      | Description                                                   |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id`    | String    | Unique user identifier                                        |
| `event_time` | Timestamp | Datetime of event                                             |
| `action`     | String    | Type of user action (`purchase`, `add_to_cart`, `view`, etc.) |
| `value`      | Double    | Monetary value of transaction                                 |

## ü•π Data Cleaning Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Schema Validation

- Ensures all required columns exist.
- Casts columns to expected types if mismatches detected.
- Strict error raised if critical columns missing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaning Steps

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
|      |             |

| **Null Removal**          | Drop rows where any of `user_id`, `event_time`, `action`, `value` are missing |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **String Normalization**  | Lowercase + trim `user_id` and `action` fields                                |
| **Missing Defaults**      | Fill nulls: `value = 0.0`, `action = unknown`                                 |
| **Negative Value Filter** | Remove rows where `value < 0`                                                 |
| **Outlier Removal**       | Optional: Filter extreme values using IQR method                              |
| **Duplicate Removal**     | Drop duplicates on `(user_id, event_time, action)`                            |
| **Future Filtering**      | Discard events with `event_time` after current timestamp                      |
