In this pipeline, there was a total of 94,954 events captured of which there were 14,181 purchases and 80,773 non-purchase events. This implies that about 15% of all the events led to a purchase while majority of events (85%) were non-purchases.

For the value statistics, these events were reported with a mean value of approximately 50.02, suggesting that on average, the event value fell slightly above 50. The standard deviation of 14.94 indicates that the event values tend to deviate from the mean by approximately 15 units. 

In terms of distribution, 25% of the data had a value of less than or equal to 39.86. The median value, which represents the 50th percentile or mid-point of the data, was around 49.99, and 75% of the data had values of 60.09 or less. The maximum event value reported was 118.77, while the minimum was about 0.20. 

It is also evident from the data that most users do not make a purchase in their session, but generally the values for each event are fairly spread out. 

The fairly large standard deviation relative to the mean suggests that there may be a significant variability in the users' behaviors or in the conditions of these events. Additional analysis and segmentation might be beneficial to understand the underlying drivers of these different behaviors and their impact on purchase frequency and value. 

Finally, given the high percentage of non-purchase events, it might be valuable to investigate these cases further to identify if there are bottlenecks or issues in the user experience journey that might be hindering conversion.
