## Overview

This report covers a dataset consisting of a total of 93,474 events. The dataset categorizes these events into two main types: Purchases and Non-purchases.

## Event Distribution

Out of the total number of events, 13,968 are categorized as Purchases whereas 79,506 events are identified as Non-Purchases. This indicates that approximately 15% of the total events result in a purchase decision.

## Value Statistics

The values across the events vary, providing a wide range of data for analysis. The summary statistics of these values are as follows:

- **Mean (Average):** The average value across all the events is approximately 49.93. This is the central value providing an overall sense of the 'typical' outcome of an event.

- **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is approximately 14.14. This measure shows the amount of variation or dispersion of the set of values. A low standard deviation could indicate that the values tend to be closer to the mean, whereas a high standard deviation might suggest greater variability among the values.

- **Minimum:** The minimum value recorded amongst all events is about 13.25. This gives us an understanding of the lowest value within the dataset.

- **25th Percentile (1st Quartile):** About 25% of the values fall below 40. This is the first quartile value, indicating that a quarter of the events have values less than 40.

- **Median (50th Percentile):** The median value is about 49.96, close to the average. This adds evidence to the average being a reliable representation of the dataset - i.e., the data is likely not skewed too much in one direction.

- **75th Percentile (3rd Quartile):** About 75% of the values are less than approximately 59.87. This means only a quarter of the total values are greater than 59.87.

- **Maximum:** The maximum value recorded amongst all events is approximately 85.67.

## Conclusion

The dataset indicates substantial engagement in terms of event participation. However, there should be strategies implemented to help drive the conversion rate higher. Further, the average value of approximately 50 suggests that most of the values fall within a moderate range, providing a stable data range for further analysis. Despite some variability in data values, the dispersion is not too wide which again, affirms the reliability
