## 📋 AI Output
The data pipeline report consists of event data along with the statistics of value. We have analyzed a total of 93,474 events. Out of these, 13,968 were purchasing events and the remaining 79,506 were non-purchasing events.

For our value statistics, we analyzed 93,474 data points with an average value of around 49.93. The standard deviation was roughly 14.14, signifying a moderate spread of data around the mean. The minimum value recorded was roughly 13.25, while the maximum value was around 85.67.

The first quartile (25%) of the data had values less than or equal to approximately 40.00, indicating that at least 25% of the values were below this. Conversely, 75% of the data had values up to around 59.87, meaning that no more than 25% of the data had values above this figure. The median or 50% percentile value was quite close to the mean at around 49.96, suggesting a relatively symmetrical data distribution.
