# Data Pipeline Report

This report gives an overview of the data that passed through the data pipeline. The dataset analyzed comprises of a total of 93,474 events. 

An event can be categorized into either a purchase or a non-purchase. According to our analysis, there were exactly 13,968 purchases and a substantially larger number of non-purchases, 79,506 to be exact. This creates a large disparity between the two categories in our dataset, where purchases make up only around 15% of all events.

As for the value statistics, this refers to some continuous variable in our dataset. The total count of the values is equal to the total number of events, confirming that this variable is not missing from any event data. The mean of these values is approximately 49.93, suggesting a balanced distribution around this score. 

In our dataset, the spread or standard deviation of the values is 14.14. This small figure indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (49.93), and thus close to each other. 

The minimum value reached as low as 13.25 and the maximum value peaked at 85.67. This shows a somewhat wide range of this continuous variable in our dataset. 

When looking at percentile distribution, it can be seen that 25% of values were under 40.00, 50% were under 49.96 (which is also the median), and 75% were under 59.87. This distribution indicates a right-skewed dataset as the mean is larger than the median. 

In conclusion, this exploration provides a solid understanding of the variables in our dataset and could aid in various future actions such as decision making, predictive modeling, and beyond. 

More in-depth analysis might be required to provide further insights, especially in analyzing the relation between these numeric values and the event type (purchase & non-purchase) to figure out if there is any causal effect.
