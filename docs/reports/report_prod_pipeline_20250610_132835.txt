## Dataset Overview

Our dataset contains a total of 93,474 events, each event being a record of a user interaction in our application. The events are classified into two types: purchases and non-purchases.

The dataset reflects that quite a few users are actively engaging with our application, but not all of them are making purchases. Indeed, out of the total events, 13,968 are purchases, which means that around 14.94% of all recorded user interactions involve a purchase.

However, the vast majority of events are non-purchases: there are 79,506 such events, which represent 85.06% of all user interactions in the dataset. These could be any form of interaction that doesn't lead directly to a purchase - for instance, browsing items, adding them to a wishlist, or reading reviews.

Such a disparity between purchases and non-purchases is not necessarily negative. Many of the non-purchase events may still contribute positively to the user experience, making users more likely to make a purchase in the future.

## Individual Event Value

A notable aspect of our dataset is the 'value' column, which quantifies the financial value associated with each event. This column has following statistical description:

- Count: 93,474. This confirms that each event in the dataset has an associated value.
- Mean: 49.93. On average, the events recorded in our dataset each correlate to around $49.93 in value.
- Standard Deviation: 14.14. The values associated with the events have a moderate degree of variation around the mean.
- Minimum: 13.25. The least valuable event in our dataset is worth $13.25.
- 25 percentile (Q1): 40.00. 25% of the events are associated with a value of $40.00 or less.
- Median (50 percentile / Q2): 49.96. Half of the events in our dataset are associated with a value of less than $49.96, and half are associated with a value greater than this. Being very close to the mean, this suggests a near symmetric distribution of values.
- 75 percentile (Q3): 59.87. 75% of the events are associated with a value of $59.87 or less.
- Maximum: 85.67. The most valuable event in our dataset is worth $85.67.
