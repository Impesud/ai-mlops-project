   - The `std` or standard deviation value is approximately 14.94. This indicates the amount of variation or dispersion of the values.
   - The `min` or minimum value among all the events is approximately 0.20 units.
   - The 1st quartile or `25%` value is approximately 39.86 units, meaning 25% of the events have a value less than or equal to this.
   - The median or middle value (`50%`) is approximately 49.99 units. This indicates that 50% of the events have a value less than or equal to this.
   - The 3rd quartile or `75%` value is approximately 60.09 units, meaning 75% of the events have a value less than or equal to this.
