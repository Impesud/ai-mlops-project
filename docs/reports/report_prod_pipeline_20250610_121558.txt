## Overview
Our data pipeline captured a total of 93,474 events. These events have been categorized as either purchases or non-purchase events. 

## Event Breakdown
Out of the total number of events, 13,968 were identified as purchases, representing 14.94% of the total. The majority of events, 79,506, were non-purchase related, representing 85.06% of the total events. 

## Value Statistics
We examined the value statistics associated with these events for a more detailed analysis. The value statistics are as follows:

- The total count of the values analysed was 93,474.
- The average (mean) value was approximately 49.93.
- The standard deviation, which shows variation or dispersion of the set of values, stood at approximately 14.14.
- The smallest (minimum) value was about 13.25.
- The first quartile (25th percentile) was around 40.00, which indicates that a quarter of the data is less than or equal to this value.
- The median value (50th percentile) was approximately 49.96. This is the middle value in the dataset, with half the data lying above and half below this value.
- The third quartile (75th percentile) was approximately 59.86, indicating that 75% of the data is less than or equal to this value.
- The largest (maximum) value in the dataset was about 85.67.

## Conclusion
This data pipeline report indicates a high volume of non-purchase related events compared to purchases, suggesting an area for potential exploration and improvement. The value statistics provide interesting insights, with only a moderate amount of variation observed due to a standard deviation of approximately 14.14. Increasing the conversion of events to purchases could improve the overall value mean from the current 49.93.
