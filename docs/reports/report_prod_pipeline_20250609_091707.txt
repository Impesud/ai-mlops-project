In assessing the dataset we processed, we've registered a total of 94,954 events. From these events, there are 14,181 recorded as purchases and 80,773 events noted as non-purchases. 

The value statistics of the dataset are as follows: 

- The number of observations is 94,954.
- The average or mean value is approximately 50.02, suggesting that the typical event in our dataset gravitates around this value.
- The standard deviation is roughly 14.94, which illustrates the dispersion or variability of our data points from the mean. The higher the standard deviation, the more spread out the data points are. In our case, the data points tend to diverge around 15 units from the average.
- The minimum value recorded in our dataset is about 0.20, while the maximum value extends up to around 118.77.
- About 25% of the data is under 39.86 (1st Quartile), and 50% of the data is under 49.99 (Median). Additionally, 75% of the observed data is under 60.09 (3rd Quartile). These percentile values, along with minimum and maximum data, help us understand the overall distribution pattern of our dataset.

It is pertinent to note the substantial difference between purchase numbers and non-purchase numbers for the total events recorded. This information may be a critical discovery for targeted marketing efforts.

Our next steps will include a deeper analysis of both the purchase and non-purchase events to determine possible patterns or correlations among the records.
